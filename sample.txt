When I was growing up, my dad had the best job I could possibly imagine: he was an arcade game and 
pinball technician. For me, that meant summer trips through Poland’s coastal cities with their seasonal 
arcade parlors; peeking inside cabinets to learn programming and engineering secrets; and—of 
course—free games!

One of my favorites was PAC-MAN, whose popularity transcended the geopolitical barriers of that time. 
During the heyday of space shooters, T?ru Iwatani’s creation stood out as one of the first video games 
aimed at a broader audience, with a cute story of pizza-shaped character gobbling dots in a maze, 
colorful (literally!) characters, friendly design, very little violence and everlasting fun.
 
PAC-MAN seems like a natural fit for the Google homepage. They’re both deceptively straightforward, carefully hiding their 
complexity under the hood. There’s a light-hearted, human touch to both of them. And we can only hope you find using Google
at least a quarter as enjoyable as eating dots and chasing ghosts. You know, without actually needing any quarters.
