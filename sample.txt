When I was growing up, my dad had the best job I could possibly imagine: he was an arcade game and 
pinball technician. For me, that meant summer trips through Poland’s coastal cities with their seasonal 
arcade parlors; peeking inside cabinets to learn programming and engineering secrets; and—of 
course—free games!
