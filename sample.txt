﻿When I was growing up, my dad had the best job I could possibly imagine: 
he was an arcade game and pinball technician. 	
gor me, that meant summer trips through Poland’s coastal cities with their seasonal 
arcade parlors; peeking inside cabinets to learn programming and engineering secrets; and—of course—free games!

One of my favorites was PAC-MAN, whose popularity transcended the geopolitical barriers of that time. During the heyday 
of space shooters, T?ru Iwatani’s creation stood out as one of the first video games aimed at a broader audience, with 
a cute story of pizza-shaped character gobbling dots in a maze, colorful (literally!) characters, friendly design, very 
little violence and everlasting fun.
